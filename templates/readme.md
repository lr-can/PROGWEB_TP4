# README â€” TP4 templates

This folder contains templates for the UE-PROGWEB TP4 exercises.

Overview
- Several templates are provided for each exercise to speed up development.
- HTML templates include an external stylesheet link; update the href if your CSS is stored in a different location.
- One standalone SVG template is included for vector graphics or inline use in pages.

How to use
1. Copy the appropriate template for the exercise you are working on.
2. Edit the HTML or SVG content as needed.
3. Open the HTML files in a browser (ensure the linked stylesheet path is correct) or edit the SVG with a text/vector editor.

Notes
- Keep a single shared stylesheet when possible to maintain consistent styling.
- Verify relative paths when moving templates between folders.
